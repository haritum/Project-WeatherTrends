# Project-Explore-WeatherTrends
In this mini-project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.


## Getting Started
This project is a part of the [Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002/). 

Sequence of steps followed for completing this project are:
1. Extract the data from the database using SQL and save as a CSV file
2. Open CSV file using Python & perform exploratory data analysis
3. Peform explanatory data analysis & make observations.
4. Prepare four interesting observations into a report.
